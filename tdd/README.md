# Test Driven Development
Focus on learning the process of test driven development.

## The TDD Cycle:

- Write a test for the next bit of functionality you want to add.
- Write the functional code until the test passes.
- Refactor both new and old code to make it well structured.

## Task
Start from the test class and implement the documented features using
test driven development. The key is to **call out which step of the process
you're in at all time**.
