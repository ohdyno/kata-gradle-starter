 * MyStack is a last in, first out (LIFO) data structure that holds generic objects, commonly known as a stack.

 * Objects can be added on top of the stack using push().
 * The object at the top of the stack can be removed with pop().
 * To see the top of the stack without removing the object, peek() could be used.
