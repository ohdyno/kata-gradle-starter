source: https://kata-log.rocks/fizz-buzz-kata

## Instructions
Apply XP techniques (TDD, refactoring, simple design, etc.) to implement the following backlog:

- Write a program that prints one line for each number from 1 to 100
- For multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number
- For the multiples of five print Buzz instead of the number
- For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz instead of the number
