# Chart Smart Refactoring

Refactoring legacy code

## Setup

- run the tests
- most likely, the image files used for Approval Tests would need to be updated because each system renders the images
  differently.
    - to update, run the test, and it should add to your clipboard a command that will update the failing test
    - paste the command in your terminal to update the approved image
